# An example of TDD with Laravel Framework

I'm switching to TDD (Test Driven Development) in my daily work. It's been a nice experience, and I'm really enjoying the TDD approach: developing in the Red, Green, Refactory cicle.

This repository, is a little example of TDD methodology implemented in a Laravel Admin Panel, where the admin users can set the order of the gallery itens by dragging and dropping the itens to the desired position. A Vue.js component handles the drag and drop stuff. The changes are automatically persisted to the database and reflected in the frontend.

## The tests

Laravel makes an awesome job related to testing

### Customizing: src/components/Menu.vue
